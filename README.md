## Part 1a
Run baseline1.py, baseline2.py, classifier1.py, classifier2.py to see the results for the two baselines and two classifier

## Part 1b

## Part 1c
See the diagram for 1c in `FinalDiagram1c.pdf`

Run `create_restaurant_info_v2.py` to create a new .csv file with extra properties

Run `dialog_system_v2.py` for the dialog system with switches and reasoning part

Four features
1. Use one of the baselines for dialog act recognition instead of the machine learning classifier
2. Ask user about correctness of match for Levenshtein results
3. OUTPUT IN ALL CAPS OR NOT (switch on/off)
4. Introduce a delay before showing system responses (switch on/off)
